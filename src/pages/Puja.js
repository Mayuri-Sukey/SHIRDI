        <p class="puja-description">
          Shri Sai Satyavrata Puja According to Chapter 13 of Shri Sai Satcharita, a devotee named Bhimaji Patil from Narayangaon was suffering from a chronic illness. Despite undergoing various medical treatments and religious rituals, he did not find relief from his ailment. Eventually, he sought refuge in Shri Saibaba based on the advice of Nanasaheb Chandorkar. With the blessings and grace of Saibaba, his illness was cured. Bhimaji Patil was a devotee of Lord Narayana (Lord Vishnu), and after experiencing the healing powers of Saibaba, he realized that Baba is the incarnation of the Supreme God, Shri Narayana. This led to the initiation of a new tradition of worship called "Shri Sai Satyavrata Puja." As a result, the worship of Saibaba's idol is now performed during the Satyanarayan Puja to fulfill the desires of Sai devotees. In the concluding chapters of the Satyanarayan Puja, Bhimaji Patil provides a brief description of his experience.
